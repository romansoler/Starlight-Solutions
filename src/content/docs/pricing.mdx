            <p class="text-sm text-gray-400 leading-relaxed">We define a "Qualified Appointment" as a meeting booked with a prospect who matches your Ideal Customer Profile (ICP), has the budget, and has the authority to buy.</p>

            <h4 class="font-bold text-white mb-2 text-lg">Do I own the code?</h4>
            <p class="text-sm text-gray-400 leading-relaxed">Yes. Unlike agencies that hold your site hostage, everything we build—infrastructure, AI agents, and funnels—is your intellectual property once paid for.</p>

            <p class="text-sm text-gray-400 leading-relaxed">We review the performance data together. If we've hit our KPIs, we transition to a retainer model for ongoing optimization and scaling.</p>

            <h4 class="font-bold text-white mb-2 text-lg">How fast can we launch?</h4>
            <p class="text-sm text-gray-400 leading-relaxed">We can usually deploy the core landing pages and ad campaigns within 14 days. Full infrastructure overhaul takes 4-6 weeks depending on complexity.</p>
